              I migrated to the United States at a young age of eleven.
              I did not speak English at the time and everything about the country was foreign to me.
              I have so much to be grateful for, the academic, professional and personal progression and opportunities this country has given me are ubiquitous.
              Understanding my potential coupled with the opportunities provided, I want to expand on my knowledge base.
              I currently hold a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and have been active in the industry for over seven years.
              I am always curious to learn about how things work.  My inquisitive nature initially led me to comprehend mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
              At the time, I thought these subjects were the building blocks of the world as we know it.
              Hence, I chose chemical engineering and made a career out of it.
              I've been very fortunate to learn from my successes and failures, both in academia and in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Immediately after graduation I assumed a position as a FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) Catalyst Engineer with a startup organization.
              In this role, I learned the full life cycle of a product, from it's infancy to being deployed at refineries.
              It was truly rewarding to understand the engineering required to formulate a product,
              the economics needed to compete in the market, meeting and exceeding the claims made to clients and all of this to be done at scale.
              I then transitioned to my current role as a Process Development Engineer in R&D realm of Polymer Science and Reaction Engineering.
              I work to optimize the building blocks of Polypropylene which is the backbone of many
              different types of plastics that almost everyone uses in one form or another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my experience I have come to realize that everything I do is dependent on technology,
              from a simple written digital message to running powerful simulations for various petrochemical processes.
              It was this realization that illuminated my path to learn about computers and software development.
              That same day, I started to collaborate with my IT team that resulted in short IT classes during our down time.
              I still remember my first lesson on servers, learning the differences between traditional and virtual servers.
              I realized my lack of knowledge in this field and acknowledged the importance of computers and programming,
              I had to do something to bring down this barrier, since I am always eagerly asking the question: why and how things happen.
              I reflected back on our first desktop in the late 90s that had a fraction of the RAM and hard-drive that modern computers have.
              Analogous to the evolution of my personal computer from the 90s is how virtual servers have changed the IT world.
              I was so inspired by the topic of servers that I obtained my very first AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in two months.
              I then moved on to learning Microsoft Azure and plan to obtain a certification in it as well.
              I realize that my certification alone will not get me anywhere, I need to understand programming
              languages and apply my knowledge in practice.

              Technology has grown exponentially, and it will not slow down.
              Problems facing the globe are only becoming more complex and the challenge will be to find relevant solutions.
              These solutions will be just as complex as the problems, requiring more powerful computers,
              sophisticated programs that run on those computers.
              Technology is and will continue to be an integral part of taking on the most complex challenges the world is engulfed in.
              I want to learn computer programming, so I can equip myself to be a part of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being an engineer, I acknowledge and recognize problems, so I can at least think of proper solutions.
              Some of the things I like to improve upon require knowledge of programming,
              without computer programming many solutions are just additional problems.
