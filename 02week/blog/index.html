      <h2>Dubai - Abu Dhabi, UAE</h2>
        <p>
          My first middle east trip!  This trip was exciting for many reasons.  First and foremost, this was mine and my wife's first international trip, together.  She was born there so naturally that was a motive in going. It was a completely different culture and environment from what I had experienced. We were able to see different lifestyles, taste different food and see the hustle and bustle of everyday U.A.E. life. Our trip to U.A.E. is what set us up for adding world tour to our bucket list.

      <h2>Makkah - Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia</h2>
      <p>
        My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 5 year anniversary, by traveling. We did some research on what places we would enjoy traveling to, and keeping in mind we wanted to do something unique. I pitched the idea to my wife about going to Saudi to perform a "minor" pilgrimage called Umrah, different from Hajj.  We agreed and started planning by learning about the culture, language, history of Islam, places to visit, etc.  In many ways, it was an overwhelming experience and in some other ways, looking at the socio-economic differences, it was disheartening and disappointing.

     <h2>Istanbul, Turkey</h2>
       <p>
        We decided to extend our Umrah vacation and stopover in Istanbul, Turkey.  Having booked tickets via Turkish Airlines made it that much easier to extend the stay. From the sights and sounds of the Souk (markets) to the smells of the Turkish Spice Bazaar, everything about this trip screamed amazing! People were humble, helpful and extremely excited to extend Turkish culture. The architecture of the Turkish Mosques were amazing. We visited the famous Blue Mosque and the experience was epic! Beautiful architecture and amazing structural creativity were amalgamated into this structure.

      <h2>Marrakesh-Casablanca, Morocco</h2>
        <p>
          The trip to Morocco was a blessing in disguise.  The original plan was to travel to Madrid, Spain but we were running late and missed the flight by 1 minute.  Luckily, this was the ONLY time we ever had insurance on the trip after over six years of domestic and international travel.  We quickly researched trip to Marrakesh and booked our travel.  Morocco is inexpensive (currency conversion $1 for approximately 10 dirhams) and again, a very different culture.  One might think after having been to UAE and Saudi, wouldn't this just be an extension of it? Not at all.  Yes, it's a Muslim majority country but their culture is heavily infused with French and Spanish culture (depending what part of Morocco you are in).

        <p>
          The two districts we explored were distinctly differentiated into French and Moroccan cultures. The French districts had everything from Macrons to
          Étouffée and Risotto. The Moroccan districts had colorful tajines with chicken, lamb and fish marinated and served to perfection. There were luxurious Moroccan lanterns that gleamed in their colorful splendor. Juice vendors squeezing lemon, orange and pomegranate juices eagerly invited us to taste quality juices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trip to Morocco was informative, exciting and extremely memorable. The people of Morocco are very respectful and considerate to foreigners and they go out of their way to help as an extension of their Moroccan hospitality.

      <h2>Frankfurt, Germany</h2>
        <p>
          My wife and I spent New Years Eve and New Years day in Frankfurt, Germany. We saw lots of fireworks on Frankfurt bridge (locals call it "The Main") and despite the weather being frigid we thoroughly enjoyed our short trip to Germany. We were drove 140 mph on the autobahn and learnt about the complexities of gaining a German driver's license. It was an excellent trip and we had lots of fun in the cold!
